According to the official website: &amp;#34;Vim is a highly configurable text editor built to make creating and changing any kind of text very efficient&amp;#34; So we know that Vim is a text editor that is designed with efficiency in mind, but what is the difference between Vim and any other editor? and why is it more efficient?
If you&amp;#39;ve never heard of vim before you are most likely used to the classic way of editing text, where you type characters with the keys to form words and you have some extra functions convincing the Ctr and Alt keys, like the classic Ctr-c and Ctr-v to copy and paste.</description></item></channel></rss>
