If you&amp;#39;ve never heard of vim before you are most likely used to the classic way of editing text, where you type characters with the keys to form words and you have some extra functions convincing the Ctr and Alt keys, like the classic Ctr-c and Ctr-v to copy and paste.</description></item></channel></rss>
