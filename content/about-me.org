Hi, this is Miguel!

I'm a *software developer* and *free software* enthusiast from Spain.
I studied Software Engineering at my home city of *A Coruña*, where I was also born and raised.

I consider myself a *Linux* enthusiast, and I've been using it almost exclusively since early 2020. A the time of writing this, my current distro of choice is *Arch Linux*, mainly for the up to date packages, you can check my [[https://github.com/migueldeoleiros/dotfiles][dotfiles]] which I update on github pretty frequently if you are interested in my setup.

Although I have some posts about *Vim*, and I'm a big fan of modal editing, I've been using *Emacs* as my text editor for years now, mainly for *org-mode*, and *org-roam*. You can check some of my notes (/which are all written in org-mode/) in my [[https://wiki.migueldeoleiros.com/][digital garden]], and also read my [[https://github.com/migueldeoleiros/emacs-conf][emacs configuration on github]].

I write most of my stuff in *English*, as a way to share it with more people, but I'm also confident in my *Portuguese*, which I learned while living in Lisbon for a short time, and of course *Spanish*, which is my native tongue.

As my bachelor's thesis I worked on a *Wayland* compositor named [[https://github.com/migueldeoleiros/turtile][turtile]] based in wlroots, while I was an intern at Igalia, as part of their *Chromium* team. While working on both this projects in C and C++ I learned a lot about systems development, and low level programing while contributing to the wider *FOSS* comunity.

This days you can find me working as a fullstack developer for *Merlin Software*, a local company in A Coruña, were I've been doing all sort of things, from making websites, AI integrations for existing products and even game development.

Feel free to contact me by [[mailto:migueldeoleiros@gmail.com][mail]] or [[https://t.me/migueldeoleiros][telegram]] if you wanna chat about tech or any other topic.
